					<h6>Description</span></h6>
					<p><strong>As we scale new heights, so do our projects. The project is a Stilt + 17 floor Residential
					tower. It is the tallest tower within its sub-locality. A development within the MHADA
					layout, its success is testament to our ability in getting things done.
					The building is built in a well connected location. The homes are designed to provide
					abundant natural light and ventilation. The USP of the project is the view from the flats.
					On one side you’ve the beautiful Gorai creek with the view of the Golden Vipassana
					Pagoda and on the other side you have an expansive green cover stretching from Borivali
					to Bhayander. With such visual delights in sight, you’ll forget that you’re living in one of
					the most densely populated cities in the world.
					With modern amenities like a Gym, CCTV surveillance, High speed lifts, Elegant elevation
					and Attractive entrance lobby , this building is fast becoming the project of choice in
					the vicinity. All 1 BHK’s and 3 BHK’s have been sold out. Last few 2 BHK units are still
					available for sale</p>
